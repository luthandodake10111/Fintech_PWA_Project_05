# Escrow Service Web Application (Fintech PWA)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is an **Escrow Service Web Application** that facilitates secure transactions between buyers and sellers. Payments are managed via **PayFast**, and funds are released only when both parties agree that the terms of the transaction have been met.

This is a **template** guide. The structure, pages, and modules defined here are starting points and **can be modified or expanded** as development progresses.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Vite
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
* **Payments:** PayFast API (Sandbox â†’ Production)
* **Hosting:** Railway (backend + DB), Vercel (frontend)
* **Authentication:** JWT (with 2FA support planned)

---

## Workflow & Collaboration

### Branching Strategy

* **main** â†’ Production-ready code (protected)
* **dev** â†’ Staging branch for integration
* **feature/**\* â†’ Feature-specific branches

### GitHub Workflow

1. Pull latest from `dev`
2. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
   ```
3. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

   ```
   feat: add transaction creation endpoint
   fix: correct login validation
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request to `dev`.
5. At least one reviewer approval required before merging.

---

## Key Notes

* This is a **template**, not a fixed rulebook.
* Teams can **add, refine, or adjust** folders and pages as development evolves.
* Backend must keep API contracts in `/docs/api-contracts/` so frontend & QA stay aligned.
* QA will test full flows (Register â†’ Create Transaction â†’ PayFast Payment â†’ Release Funds â†’ History/Disputes).

---

## Development Milestones (Suggested)

1. **Sprint 1:** Authentication + Database setup.
2. **Sprint 2:** Transactions + PayFast integration.
3. **Sprint 3:** Disputes + Admin + Full integration testing.

---

## Collaboration

This structure and page list exist to give us a **shared starting point**. As requirements expand, each team will refine their part while keeping the whole project aligned.
